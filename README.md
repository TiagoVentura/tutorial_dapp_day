# Network Analysis in R and Python -  SICSS FGV DAPP Brasil

This repository contains the materials, in R, to implement part of the exercises related to "DAPP DAY" in [SICSS Brasil](https://sicss.io/2021/fgv-dapp-brazil/)

It's a simple tutorial doing Twitter API data collection and network analysis. The idea is that this tutorial can help you implement some of the discussions brought by the DAPP team on the use of Boolean rules and theories from the field of linguistics when building queries for collecting digital data.

This tutorial implements part of what was presented and discussed by the DAPP team, however, using R. The tutorial in Python can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1g0-rMIu_lWPvKQMS6bUbbn7wjBEsomoD/view ?usp=sharing)
